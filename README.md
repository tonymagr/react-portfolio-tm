## Description

React-Portfolio-TM (Tony Magrady) website showcases my portfolio of applications developed in Berkeley Full Stack Development boot camp class (2023 - 2024). 
I intend to add to this portfolio in my professional career as a full stack developer. <br>
 
## Website

React-Portfolio-TM is deployed on Netlify and can be accessed at:  https://react-portfolio-tm.netlify.app/. <br><br>

## RunLocal

Install vite:
- In your project, you can install the vite CLI using npm. <br>
$ npm install -D vite

- Create an index.html file like this:
<br>
`<p>Hello Vite!</p>`

- Then run the appropriate CLI command in your terminal: <br>
$ npx vite
- The index.html will be served on http://localhost:5173.
- Full vite reference:  https://vite.dev/guide/
<br><br>

Local run command for React-Portfolio-TM:
- npm run dev

## Usage

There are five sections of portfolio information in the website: 
1. About Me
2. Contact Information
3. Resume
4. GitHub Profile
5. Portfolio page of my web applications
<br>

<p style="text-align: left;">Portfolio page is formatted to allow additions over time. The front-end is developed in React, to make use of virtual DOM and responsive single-page application (SPA) features.</p>

## Libraries

This web application uses the following libraries:
- Vite build tool
- ESLint for dev-time code syntax analysis
- React
- React-dom
- Sass to create style sheets

I appreciate the Berkeley Boot Camp live sessions on the topic of React, in addition to the many links to reference documents and examples shared by the instructors.
