            I completed the Berkeley Full Stack Web Development boot camp, which was very educational and rewarding. <br/>
            I am pursuing a career in application development, primarily full-stack web development. <br/>
            I am employed as an IT project manager supporting security and infrastructure projects. I have a PMP certification and 
            use PMI project methodology in my profession. <br/>
            I live with my wife in Las Vegas NV, both originally from Chicago IL, where my daughter now lives. <br/>
            My hobbies are collecting music, hiking, and participating in church and Knights of Columbus events.
