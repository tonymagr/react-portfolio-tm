        <p>
            Most recently I completed the Berkeley Full Stack Web Development boot camp, which was very educational and rewarding! 
            I am employed as an IT project manager supporting security and infrastructure projects. I have a PMP certification and 
            use PMI project methodology in my profession. <br/>
            I plan to either seek a full-time employment position as an application developer or become a free-lance developer.<br/>
            I live with my wife and daughter in Las Vegas, NV, and we all hail from Chicago, IL. My hobbies are collecting music, 
            running, and participating in the local Knights of Columbus events.
